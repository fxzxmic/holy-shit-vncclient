# holy-shit-vncclient
An extremely crappy Wayland VNC client based on GTK and libvncclient. But it works.

## Why
I just want a VNC client that's as simple and focused on client functionality as [vncviewer](https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc/tree/master/vncviewer). But unfortunately, it's an X11 application and has no plans to migrate to Wayland in the long run.

## Warn
This is a terrible program â€” use it with caution. Its advantage is that it works; its downside is that it *just* works.
